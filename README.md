# Reaction-Time-Experiments

Experiments to determine how reaction times are related to varying visual stimuli using Arduino and Processing. The subject is required to press a certain button when a certain LED and/or color is seen.

Experiment 1: Single LED 
Experiment 2: Two Color LED
Experiment 3: Three Color LED
Experiment 4: Two Space LED
Experiment 5: Three Space LED

Each directory includes the schematic for the experiment, the Arduino code, the Processing code and the histogram of results. 
In the main directory there is also a summary of the results and schematics and the mean and RMS values for each experiment calculated using R.
